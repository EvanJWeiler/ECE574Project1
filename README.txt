3. For out critical path of modules we ran the synthesis of the
module then ran the "Report timing summary" which allowed us to 
view the "unconstrained paths" and then "setup".  We then took the
longest of the paths possible in order to get the "critical path".
For the manual calculation of the circuit we added the critical path
of each module with the correct bit widths to get the estimation.  
For the circuit the process was the same as the modules.
